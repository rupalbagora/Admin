ðŸŸ¢ Step 1 : Log in to get a token

Since your routes are protected by protect middleware, you need a JWT token for authentication.

In Postman, create a POST request to your login endpoint, e.g.:

POST http://localhost:5000/api/users/login


Send your login JSON body:

{
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}


You should get a response with a token (e.g. eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1Ni...).

ðŸ‘‰ Copy that token â€” weâ€™ll use it for all the other requests.

ðŸŸ¢ Step 2: Create a Package

In Postman:

Method: POST

URL:

http://localhost:5000/api/packages


Go to the Headers tab â†’ add:

Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>


Body â†’ raw â†’ JSON:

{
  "title": "Premium Haircut",
  "price": 50,
  "services": ["Haircut", "Shampoo"],
  "about": "Top-notch haircut service",
  "discount": "10%",
  "serviceList": ["Scalp Massage", "Hot Towel"],
  "category": "male"
}


Send the request.
âœ… Expected response: 201 Created

{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "_id": "65123abc...",
    "title": "Premium Haircut",
    ...
    "addedBy": "650ffxyz..."  // your user ID
  }
}

--------

ðŸŸ¢ Step 3: Get All Packages
GET http://localhost:5000/api/packages


Add the same Authorization: Bearer <token> header.

âœ… Expected: an array of packages that belong to the logged-in user.

ðŸ‘‰ You can also test filtering by category:

GET http://localhost:5000/api/packages?category=male

--------

ðŸŸ¢ Step 4: Get a Single Package by ID
GET http://localhost:5000/api/packages/<PACKAGE_ID>


Include the token header.

Replace <PACKAGE_ID> with the _id returned in step 3.

------

ðŸŸ¢ Step 5: Delete a Package
DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/packages/<PACKAGE_ID>


Requires Authorization: Bearer <token> header.

User must have admin or superadmin role.

âœ… Expected:

{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Package deleted successfully"
}
